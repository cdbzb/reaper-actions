MRS. ROONEY: Is that you, Christy?

CHRISTY: It is, Ma'am.

 MRS. ROONEY: I thought the hinny was familiar. How is your poor wife?

CHRISTY: No better, Ma'am.

MRS. ROONEY: Your daughter then?

CHRISTY: No worse, Ma'am.

Silence.

MRS. ROONEY: Why do you halt? (Pause.) But why do I halt?

Silence.

CHRISTY: Nice day for the races, Ma'am.

MRS. ROONEY: No doubt it is. (Pause.) But will it hold up? (Pause. With emotion.) Will it hold up?

Silence.

CHRISTY: I suppose you wouldn't--

MRS. ROONEY: Histl! (Pause.) Surely to goodness that cannot be the up mail I hear already?

Silence. The hinny neighs. Silence.

CHRISTY: Damn the mail.

MRS. ROONEY: Oh thank God for that! I could have sworn I heard it, thundering up the track in the far distance. (Pause.) So hinnies whinny. Well, it is not surprising.

CHRISTY: I suppose you wouldn't be in need of a small load of dung?

MRS. ROONEY: Dung? What class of dung?

CHRISTY: Stydung.

MRS. ROONEY: Stydung . . . I like your frankness, Christy. (Pause.) I'll ask the master. (Pause.) Christy.

CHRISTY: Yes, Ma'am.

MRS. ROONEY: Do you find anything . . . bizarre about my way of speaking? (Pause.) I do not mean the voice. (Pause.) No, I mean the words. (Pause. More to herself.) I use none but the simplest words, I hope, and yet I sometimes find my way of speaking very . . . bizarre. (Pause.) Mercy! What was that?

CHRISTY: Never mind her, Maam, she's very fresh in herself to-day.

Silence.

MRS. ROONEY: Dung? What would we want with dung, at our time of life? (Pause.) Why are you on your feet down on the road? Why do you not climb up on the crest of your manure and let yourself be carried along? Is it that you have no head for heights?

Silence.

CHRISTY: (to the hinny). Yep! (Pause. Louder.) Yep wiyya to hell owwa that!

Silence.

MRS. ROONEY: She does not move a muscle. (Pause.) I too should be getting along, if I do not wish to arrive late at the station. (Pause.) But a moment ago she neighed and pawed the ground. And now she refuses to advance. Give her a good welt on the rump. (Sound of welt. Pause.) Harder! (Sound of welt. Pause.) Well! If someone were to do that for me I should not dally. (Pause.) How she gazes at me to be sure, with her great moist cleg-tormented eyes! Perhaps if I were to move on, down the road, out of her field of vision . . . (Sound of welt.) No, no, enough! Take her by the snaffle and pull her eyes away from me. Oh this is awful! (She moves on. Sound of her dragging feet.) What have I done to deserve all this, what, what? (Dragging feet.) So long ago . . . No! No! (Dragging feet. Quotes.) "Sigh out a something something tale of things, Done long ago and ill done." (She halts.) How can I go on, I cannot. Oh let me just flop down flat on the road like a big fat jelly out of a bowl and never move again! A great big slop thick with grit and dust and flies, they would have to scoop me up with a shovel. (Pause.) Heavens, there is that up mail again, what will become of me! (The dragging steps resume.) Oh I am just a hysterical old hag I know, destroyed with sorrow and pining and gentility and church-going and fat and rheumatism and childlessness. (Pause. Brokenly.) Minnie! Little Minnie! (Pause.) Love, that is all I asked, a little love, daily, twice daily, fifty years of twice daily love like a Paris horsebutcher's regular, what normal woman wants affection? A peck on the jaw at morning, near the ear, and another at evening, peck, peck, till you grow whiskers on you. There is that lovely laburnum again.
